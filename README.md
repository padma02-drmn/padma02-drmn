# Hi, I'm Kadek Padma Darmawan 👋

I build **Rust** and **Python** tooling — with a focus on **automation** and **Web3/DeFi security**.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Rust (CLI tools, simulators)
- Python (automation, data pipelines)
- Solidity (smart contract work)

## ⭐ Featured (Public) Projects

- **OracleX (Rust)** — Oracle desynchronization risk simulator for DeFi auditing

> Note: I keep forks out of my portfolio highlights unless I’ve made significant original contributions.

## 🔭 Current Focus

- DeFi security research & tooling
- Rust CLI ergonomics + performance
- Practical automation that ships
